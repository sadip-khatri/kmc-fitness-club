        <h1>TERMS AND CONDITION</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h1>Terms and conditions</h1>
        <p>These terms and conditions (“Agreement”) set forth the general terms 
            and conditions of your use of the KMC Fitness club.com.np website (“Website” or “Service”) 
            and any of its related products and services (collectively, “Services”). 
            This Agreement is legally binding between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and KMC Fitness club
            (“KMC Fitness club”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of 
            a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity 
            to this agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity.
            If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this agreement,
            you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use the Website and Services. 
            By accessing and using the Website and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood,
            and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a
            contract between you and KMC Fitness club, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed 
            by you, and it governs your use of the Website and Services.</p>

        <h1>Accounts and membership</h1>
        <p>If you create an account on the Website, you are responsible for maintaining the security of 
            your account and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account 
            and any other actions taken in connection with it. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor 
            and review new accounts before you may sign in and start using the Services. Providing false 
            contact information of any kind may result in the termination of your account. You must immediately
            notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of security. 
            We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind 
            incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account 
            (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or 
            that your conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your 
            account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We may block your email 
            address and Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.</p>

        <h1>Links to other resources</h1>
        <p>Although the Website and Services may link to other resources (such as websites, mobile applications,
            etc.), we are not, directly or indirectly, implying any approval, association, sponsorship,
            endorsement, or affiliation with any linked resource, unless specifically stated herein. We are not 
            responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses or 
            individuals or the content of their resources. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for 
            the actions, products, services, and content of any other third parties. You should carefully review 
            the legal statements and other conditions of use of any resource which you access through a link on 
            the Website. Your linking to any other off-site resources is at your own risk.</p>
        
        <h1>Changes and amendments</h1>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify this Agreement or its terms related to the Website and Services at 
            any time at our discretion. When we do, we will post a notification on the main page of the Website
            . We may also provide notice to you in other ways at our discretion, such as through the contact 
            information you have provided.
            <br><br>
            An updated version of this Agreement will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised 
            Agreement unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Website and Services after the 
            effective date of the revised Agreement (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute 
            your consent to those changes.</p>
        
        <h1>Acceptance of these terms</h1>
        <p>You acknowledge that you have read this Agreement and agree to all its terms and conditions.
